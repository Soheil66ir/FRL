# Federated Reinforcement (TD3+HER) Learning for Gymnasium-Robotics Fetch environments

==========================================================================================

This repository includes an implementation of a **TD3** (Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient) agent with **Hindsight Experience Replay (HER)**, along with **Federated Learning (FL)** capabilities using Flower. The objective is to train a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent both independently and in a federated setting within a robotic environment with sparse rewards.




**To train a single RL agent, please refer to the Readme.md file in the Reinforcement Learning directory.**

**To train multiple agents in a federated setting, please refer to the Readme.md file in the Federated Reinforcement Learning directory.**
